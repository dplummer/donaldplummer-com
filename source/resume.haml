  # Donald Plummer's Resume

  Last updated #{Date.today.strftime("%B %d, %Y")}

  ## Summary

  With experience as a systems administrator and software developer, my
  greatest strength is my understanding of the whole system. Whether its TCP
  dumps, N+1 queries or email syntax issues, I've had a lot of experience
  troubleshooting.

  I'm passionate about writing maintanable code as a conversation between
  myself and future developers. I love solving problems for customers and
  providing more value and efficiency.

  I'm confidient in what I know, and in myself. This means I have no problems
  saying "I don't know" or asking clarifying questions. My communcation style
  is a bit blunt and to the point, but I welcome critisism and retrospectives.
  I'm always seeking to grow myself as a developer and a team member.
